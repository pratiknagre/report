Python is a popular high-level programming language that is widely used for a variety of purposes, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing, and more. It was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.
Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use. It has a clear and concise syntax that makes it easy to learn, even for beginners. Python is also an interpreted language, which means that it does not need to be compiled before it can be executed. Instead, Python code is translated into machine-readable bytecode at runtime, making it easier to write and debug code.
Python has a large and active community of developers who have created a vast number of libraries and tools that extend its capabilities. These libraries and tools cover a wide range of domains, from scientific computing and data analysis to web development and game development, making Python a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of tasks.
